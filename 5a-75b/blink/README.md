# BLINK 5A-75B

Blink LED on a Colorlight 5A-75B Board

On a v6.1 board (which has an ECP5-25K device with a CABGA381 package) just
run `make` to compile, and `make prog` to program the bitstream into the FPGA.

On a v7.0 board, with a CABGA256 package, do `make V70=1` and `make V70=1 prog` instead.
